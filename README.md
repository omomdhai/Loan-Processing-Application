- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular
- **Backend**: Java, JDBC, Spring Data, Hibernate
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Automation**: Selenium for UI tests, Junit for API tests
- **Modeling**: Python: Scikit-Learn

### Additional Notes:
- Make sure to replace placeholders like `your_database_name` and `your_password` with actual values at LPA\LPA_BE\src\main\resources\application.properties
- Add bureeauData at LPA\Database\Query to add Bureaudata.
- Add Modelling Data at LPA\Model\Modeling dataset.csv.
- Run LPA\Model\Final Model.ipynb to get score.
